[Vulkan Tutorial by Alexander Overvoorde](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/) implemented in C# using [Silk.NET](https://github.com/dotnet/Silk.NET)

Make sure the Vulkan SDK is installed to be able to compile shaders and use validation layers.
[Imagesharp](https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp) is used to load textures.

To make the Vulkan code more readable it has been broken up into objects in a similar way to [Vulkan HPP RAII](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Hpp).
